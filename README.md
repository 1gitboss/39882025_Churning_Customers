# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn is a critical challenge, especially for large companies, impacting revenues directly, particularly in sectors like telecommunications. 
Companies aim to develop predictive models to identify potential customer churn and take proactive measures to mitigate it.

# Model Overview
The implemented model is a multi-layer processing model designed for customer churn prediction. 
Once deployed, it takes user input and returns a categorical value, indicating whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

# Repository Contents
- CustomerChurnDeployment.py: This script showcases the deployment of the model using Streamlit.
It accepts user input, encodes it, and runs it through the deployed model to predict churn probability.

- Model.H5: This file contains the saved model, which is loaded and deployed by the CustomerChurnDeployment.py script.

- Deployment Video: Explore the deployment video to understand the functionality of the deployed app.

# Usage
Run CustomerChurnDeployment.py using Streamlit to deploy the model.
Input user data through the app.
The model predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on the input.
# Code Details
Refer to the .py and .ipynb files in this repository for in-depth descriptions of the implemented models and the underlying code.
